# Order-Tracking-Incremental-Data-Load-Project
Developed and implemented an incremental data load pipeline for an order tracking system using Databricks and Delta Lake. The project involved processing order status updates and ensuring that the target table always reflected the most recent status for each order. Key statuses included "order placed," "shipped," "in transit," and "delivered."
